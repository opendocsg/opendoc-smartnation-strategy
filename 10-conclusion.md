# Conclusion

{:start="82"}

82.	The digital revolution can either be exhilarating or terrifying, or both. It depends on whether we are ready. Either way, it will be necessary to keep Singapore an exceptional nation. That is why we have embarked on Smart Nation, and should continue to drive it with a great sense of urgency.

83.	The Government will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure, create open platforms, share open data, encourage our businesses to adopt the latest technologies and facilitate skills upgrading and digital readiness for citizens.

84.	Businesses will also need to rise to the occasion to make structural and financial investments in digital technologies, cultivating talents and shifting mind-sets that will be necessary for the future. Singaporeans must be flexible, eager to learn, and adventurous to venture beyond our shores.

85.	The digital era is rapidly evolving, but we have never been better prepared to shape the future as we are now. Together, as a nation for our nation.
