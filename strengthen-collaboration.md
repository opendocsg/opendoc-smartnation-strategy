# Strengthen Singapore’s collaboration with the international community

## Strengthening Singapore’s connectivity with the world

{:start="77"}

77. Singapore has thrived as a transport and logistics hub with a world-class airport and port, physically connected to the world. To respond nimbly to a rapidly changing world, Singapore needs to drive seamless online-offline connectivity, to make Singapore a desired hub for critical trade and information flows. Singapore will continue to invest in digital infrastructure and programmes with our regional and international partners, layering on digital services to deepen our physical connectivity.

78. In addition to physical connectivity, Singapore also participates in the **APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) Systems**. The APEC CBPR/PRP Systems provide the participants an avenue for cross-border data transfers as they all adhere to an APEC-approved standard set of certification requirements. This reduces the challenge of organisations having to comply with multiple systems of domestic laws when they operate in multiple APEC Economies. Companies that achieve APEC CBPR or PRP certifications will be differentiated as trusted data processors that adhere to regionally approved and recognised data protection standards.

## Sharing best practices and exchange of ideas

79. Singapore will also continue to be an active player in regional and international technology conferences, contributing to discussions, thought leadership and scholarship around technology regulation and norms. We actively welcome international counterparts to visit and co-organise activities and exchanges.

## Building long-term relationships to address shared challenges

80. As technology develops, new challenges common to all cities and countries will emerge. Singapore will continue to strengthen our relationship with regional and international partners to work closely on global challenges, such as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and cyber defence.

## ASEAN Smart Cities Network

The ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) is a collaborative platform where ASEAN Member States work towards the common goal of smart and sustainable urban development with technology as an enabler. 26 cities from the 10 ASEAN countries have been named pilot cities for this network, including Singapore, Johor Bahru, Phuket, Yangon, Phnom Penh and Vientiane.

At the inaugural meeting in July 2018, the ASEAN Member States formally endorsed the ASEAN Smart Cities Framework. Member cities also shared their action plans and smart city projects and kick-started collaboration with private-sector solution providers for commercially viable projects.

Singapore is also leading the efforts to develop an **ASEAN Framework on Digital Data Governance** to facilitate harmonisation of data regulations. This Framework will help organisations enjoy more clarity, potentially save on compliance costs by minimising the challenges of addressing multiple data protection standards across different jurisdictions, and boost consumer confidence in the participating organisation’s standard of handling consumers’ data responsibly.

## Regional and International Cooperation on Cybersecurity

ASEAN leaders also reaffirmed the need to build closer cooperation and coordination with each other on cybersecurity policy development and capacity building initiatives, recognising that cybersecurity is a cross-cutting issue that requires coordinated expertise from multiple stakeholders across different domains. The cyber domain is also an opportunity for significant regional economic and technological development. 

IMDA actively engages international counterparts through platforms such as Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT), Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) and ASEAN Cert Incident Drill (ACID). Critical Infocomm Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) is another key area of focus in international collaboration. IMDA is an active participant in the Meridian Process which provides a platform for Governments to discuss how to work together on CIIP at the policy level.
