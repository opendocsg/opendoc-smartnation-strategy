  <li>To effectively harness the power of digital infrastructure, data and to ensure cybersecurity, we will need to support our people to be Smart Nation-ready by inculcating new mind-sets and promoting upskilling.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="promoting-an-innovation-and-technology-culture">Promoting an innovation and technology culture</h2>

<ol start="46">
  <li>
    <p>As individuals, we need to consider two key shifts. First, a shift from linear pathways of education employment, to needing an attitude of <strong>lifelong learning and upskilling</strong>. In the past, once a person had a good education, he would most likely be prepared for his career and the rest of his life. Today, that concept has been disrupted by the necessity for lifelong learning, especially with technology. Every job of the future will evolve with technological change and require a higher level of digital literacy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, individuals need to shift in from being a consumer to an <strong>active co-creator and contributor</strong>. The Government cannot, and should not be the solution to all problems. In many ways, individuals are already actively using digital tools to shape their communities. For example, many informal WhatsApp and Facebook groups bring individuals together to rally around specific causes. Civic and community groups can harness open data and APIs on data.gov.sg to co-create new solutions and work with Government to serve needs and advance causes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our companies and institutions, no matter how large or small, can no longer operate business-as-usual. We will need to aspire to be “intelligent to the core” and strengthen integration between business operations, people and technology. Organisations need to think deeply about how to be <strong>mission and customer-centric</strong>, and prioritise investing in capabilities to manage their data and digital systems effectively and securely. Technologies like cloud computing and AI will fundamentally shift business operations, and organisations will need to rethink how it builds capabilities for its people and systems in tandem.</p>

    <p>As a nation, we need to have a <strong>“dare to try” mind-set</strong> and be open to experiment with new ideas and take manageable risks. At the same time, we must be willing to embrace failure – fail fast and learn quickly, and have the resilience to bounce back and try again. The Government will lead by example by allowing more flexibility in resource allocation for technology projects and public sector innovation. To support industry, the Government will also adopt a balanced regulatory approach to support innovation, and step in only when needed in the public interest, such as for consumer safety, public interest or in ensuring the stability of national systems. Regulatory sandboxes and test-beds have already been set up to support innovation in areas such as drones, autonomous vehicles and fintech, to facilitate innovation while providing the Government the time to better understand the potential of the technologies alongside the innovation process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also focus on <strong>strengthening Singapore’s relationship with the world</strong>. Technology increasingly transcends borders and the acceleration of technological change enhances the benefits and dangers of globalisation. Singapore has the unique opportunity of being a Global-Asia node for technology and innovation. Singaporeans are encouraged to learn from the best abroad and apply their knowledge back home. At the same time, we will need to collaborate closely with our regional and global partners, as well as Singaporeans abroad, to build common digital infrastructure and norms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, our schools nurture our students to thrive in a rapidly-changing world by developing confident, independent learners who have the skills and heart to contribute back to their communities. These skills are captured in the <strong>21st Century Competencies framework</strong>. We will also consider how to prepare our population to think computationally in the digital age, and continually review school curriculum and programmes to ensure relevance to the future workplace and society.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-digitally-ready-workforce-to-seize-new-opportunities">Building a digitally-ready workforce to seize new opportunities</h2>

<ol start="52">
  <li>
    <p>Singapore needs to have a ready pool of skilled ICT manpower, who can help companies and the Government seize opportunities in digitalisation as and when they arise. At the same time, as the use of digital technologies becomes more pervasive, today’s working population would need to reskill to be ready for jobs in a digital age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Central to this effort is the national <strong>SkillsFuture</strong> movement. As part of SkillsFuture, tripartite partners have established the <strong>TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA)</strong>, which offers various programmes to cultivate digital leaders, upskill our ICT workforce and to support non-ICT professionals who wish to transit to the ICT sector. Another programme is the <strong>SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace</strong>, aimed at equipping all Singaporeans with the mind-set and basic functional skills for the future economy. Businesses will need to prioritise upskilling their employees, and individuals are encouraged to cultivate a habit of lifelong learning. The Government will similarly put in place programmes to raise the <strong>digital literacy of public officers</strong>, with a goal of training 20,000 public officers in data analytics and data science by 2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To strengthen in-house digital capabilities in the public sector, we have established a <strong>Centre of Excellence for ICT and Smart Systems (ICT&amp;SS)</strong> in GovTech. The Centre of Excellence houses capability centres in Data Science and AI, Sensors and IoT, ICT Infrastructure, Applications Development, Cybersecurity and Geospatial Technology, and will support the rest of Government in building technical capabilities. To groom more technology leaders, we are also reviewing our public sector leadership schemes to establish <strong>clearer career pathways for ICT&amp;SS talent</strong> to meet their aptitudes and aspirations, and are also introducing a <strong>Government-wide ICT&amp;SS scheme of service</strong>, as a means to enhance the Government ICT&amp;SS career proposition. The recently launched Smart Nation Scholarship signals our commitment to growing technology expertise in the public sector. To optimise the deployment of our technical talent, and achieve greater interoperability and economies of scale of digital systems, we are also <strong>strengthening functional leadership for the ICT&amp;SS profession</strong> to better coordinate the efforts of the community across the whole-of-Government.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our economic agencies will continue to support multinational corporations and local enterprises to ensure that Singapore remains an attractive place for top international talent and firms to relocate here, and for overseas Singaporeans to return home. Especially for fields where talent is scarce, we will review talent attraction schemes and create meaningful work for to attract top talent, which will in turn support native capability building. To leverage expertise outside of Government, the <strong>Smart Nation Fellowship</strong> brings top data scientists and technologists to Singapore to collaborate with the Government on specific projects for short to medium-term stints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can do all these right, we can get the right mix of local and foreign talent to make Singapore a creative, fertile innovative and enterprising environment.</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-everyone-benefits-from-smart-nation">Ensuring everyone benefits from Smart Nation</h2>

<ol start="57">
  <li>
    <p>In a Smart Nation, everyone will benefit. Technology will be so seamlessly integrated in our infrastructure and institutions, everyone, regardless of technological ability would enjoy significant improvements in day-to-day living. For example, sensors can help detect when an elderly person has fallen down and alert the relevant personnel, without him or her having to actually operate technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technology also has the power to be a social leveller. Hence, we need to dedicate resources to ensure that all Singaporeans, including the vulnerable, such as the elderly, low-income and persons with disabilities, are able to seize the opportunities offered by digital technologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will work closely together with the people and private sectors to deliver on the <strong>Digital Readiness Blueprint</strong>, which outlines initiatives to help all Singaporeans, regardless of age or ability, to have digital access and literacy to participate in Smart Nation. For example, we will look into how we can enhance our support for vulnerable segments to have basic digital enablers, including internet connectivity and smart devices. Already, initiatives like the <strong>Home Access Programme and Enable IT programme</strong> are proactively supporting segments in need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will also work with tripartite partners to raise digital service standards and establish digital concierge-like services and digital clinics in the community, to assist those who are less comfortable with technology wth using digital services. Businesses and individuals can volunteer with <strong>IMDA’s Silver Infocomm Initiative</strong> to help bridge the digital divide among seniors (aged 50 years and above), and empower seniors to live a digital lifestyle for greater convenience and to connect to the community. IMDA has also rolled out a Basic Digital Skills curriculum which articulates a set of basic digital skills everyone needs to enjoy greater convenience and participate meaningfully in a Digital Society.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will also uphold the principle of digital inclusion by design, ensuring that all products and services align with international accessibility standards, and encouraging businesses to do likewise. The Government will constantly review its Digital Service Standards to ensure that its digital standards and design principles are inclusive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond this, the Government will support digital projects and that create opportunities for community participation, as well as ground-up efforts that encourage more Singaporeans to adopt technology.</p>
