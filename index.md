1.  A Smart Nation is a transformed Singapore where people will be more
    empowered to live meaningful and fulfilled lives, enabled seamlessly
    by technology, that offers exciting opportunities for all. It is
    where businesses can be more productive and seize new opportunities
    in the digital economy. It is a nation which collaborates with our
    international partners to deliver digital solutions and link and
    benefit people and businesses across boundaries. As PM Lee described
    it at the launch of Smart Nation in November 2014, it is a nation
    "where we can create possibilities for ourselves beyond what we
    imagined possible."

[]{#_Toc524727834 .anchor}**Why Smart Nation?**

2.  We are at a most exciting and dynamic time in human history, and
    stand at the cusp of a new industrial revolution fuelled by digital
    technologies. Technological disruption is a global force we must
    confront and harness to our advantage. Today, developments in
    digital technologies are rapidly advancing, and the next frontier of
    technologies -- big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI),
    Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics -- will fundamentally
    transform the global economy and change the way we live, work and
    relate to one another.

3.  Digitalisation will be pervasive, and change life as we know it.
    Many of today's institutions, norms and habits, were designed around
    industrialisation. Similarly, our strategies and structures today
    will change with technology, and our adaptability to change will
    determine our success and ability to stay ahead.

4.  Smart Nation is integral to Singapore's next phase of nation
    building. To continue to prosper and stay relevant in the world,
    Singapore needs to ride the waves of the digital revolution and
    capture the opportunities it brings, just as we embraced
    globalisation before. Digitalisation presents opportunities for
    Singapore to enhance Singapore's traditional strengths, address and
    overcome our national challenges and physical limits, be it resource
    constraints or an ageing population, as well as build new sources of
    comparative advantage for Singapore. This new era of digital
    transformation will power Singapore to SG100 and beyond.

5.  To achieve Smart Nation, we start from a position of strength,
    riding on Singapore's early investments in technology and
    connectivity infrastructure, and strong institutions that are ready
    to seize these opportunities. Our people are also digitally
    literate, with a strong pool of talent who perform well in the STEM
    (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines.

[]{#_Toc524727835 .anchor}**A Brief History of Singapore's National
Digitalisation Efforts**

6.  Singapore has done this before. In our history, we have undergone
    two successful whole-of-nation transformations in response to
    digital disruption. First, with **National Computerisation** from
    the 1980s to early-1990s, to transform Singapore into a regional
    centre for computer software development and services. Second, with
    the **growth of the info-communications industry** from the
    mid-1990s to early-2010s, to transform Singapore into a
    hyper-networked, global hub for services.

7.  It was in the early 1980s that the Government recognised
    computerisation as an essential tool for competing against the rest
    of the world, and mobilised the nation to embrace new technology.
    Since then, six national Info-communications Technology (ICT)
    masterplans have been launched. In the formative years, the focus
    was to computerise government agencies and drive up the quality and
    number of IT professionals in Singapore. Subsequent masterplans
    focused on extending computerisation and connectivity to the private
    sector.

8.  While each masterplan had a different emphasis to address challenges
    of the period, the underlying objectives have been clear and
    consistent -- to guide the use of ICT to enhance Singapore's
    international competitiveness, upgrade the skills of citizens
    especially the workforce, improve service standards, and attract
    knowledge-intensive activities.

[]{#_Toc524727836 .anchor}**What Would a Smart Nation Look Like?**

9.  Today, Singapore is at another pivotal moment in its digital
    transformation journey. The pace of technological invention and
    innovation is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, and we must do
    better to fully harness this power and potential to improve lives
    and create opportunities.

10. Our Smart Nation journey endeavours to **transform Singapore through
    technology.** Technology is only a means to an end, to enable
    significant improvements in how we live, work and play. We cannot
    simply apply the latest technologies on top of our existing
    processes and organisations. It will require a fundamental rethink
    of our long-held assumptions and how we operate.

11. As a nation and city-state, Singapore's Smart Nation initiative is
    unique among the efforts of many other smart cities. Singapore's
    single layer of Government not only seeks to improve city and
    municipal services through technology, but has the capacity to drive
    transformation at the national scale. At a national level, we are
    able to drive economic and civic engagement, as well as enable
    efficient and effective planning and administration. At the same
    time, we can drive transformation in critical areas such as energy
    management, national security, trade and foreign relations. We are
    able and ready to make bold changes that will improve all aspects of
    our people's lives.

12. Our priority is to harness technology to address national challenges
    and drive transformation in key domains: **health, transport, urban
    solutions, finance, and education.**

    -   **Health.** Our healthcare system will move beyond healthcare to
        > health, as Singaporeans will be better equipped and empowered
        > to take care of their own health. Healthcare services, where
        > they are needed, will be delivered efficiently. Singaporeans
        > are already using wearable devices or smartphones to monitor
        > their health and activities, and this data can empower
        > individuals and inform service delivery.

    -   **Transport.** Data analytics, smart systems and autonomous
        > vehicles are key solutions for the future of transport
        > planning and operations. Our roads and transport system will
        > be optimised, making traffic smoother, public transport more
        > comfortable and reliable, and the air cleaner with less need
        > for private cars.

    -   **Urban Solutions.** Our homes and estates will be safer, more
        > comfortable and more sustainable. The use of sensors and smart
        > systems will improve the effectiveness of municipal services,
        > save energy, and reduce the current reliance on manpower.

    -   **Finance.** Singapore will continue to be a leading regional
        > and global financial hub, powered by financial institutions
        > that readily adopt technologies for better customer service,
        > greater efficiencies in trade finance, strengthened
        > supervision and reduced compliance cost.

    -   **Education.** Digital technology unlocks a new realm of
        > self-directed and collaborative learning. Relationships
        > between students, teachers and parents, as well as
        > capabilities of the physical infrastructure are augmented to
        > create a holistic and conducive environment for effective
        > learning. Routine and repetitive tasks are automated to help
        > educators focus on the work that matters.

13. At its core, Smart Nation is about elevating **our people**.
    Everyone is part of Smart Nation, and will be empowered to enjoy the
    opportunities and conveniences of a digital society. This means
    having the means to transact digitally, the skills and confidence to
    use technology, and the agility to adapt to change and keep up with
    the latest technologies to achieve a better quality of life. This
    will put us in good stead for an ever-changing global environment.

[]{#_Toc524727837 .anchor}**Who Contributes to Smart Nation?**

14. Smart Nation is for **Singapore, and Singaporeans**. It requires a
    whole-of-nation effort, involving every Government agency, every
    business, and also our people. The Government will take
    responsibility for the digital transformation of Government
    functions and services, and businesses must step up to transform and
    keep up with the winds of technological change. At the same time,
    Government will partner the people sector to drive the digital
    readiness and harness technology for stronger social cohesion.

[]{#_Toc524727838 .anchor}**How Do We Become a Smart Nation?**

15. Singapore has laid out mutually-reinforcing plans to build a
    **Digital Economy, Digital Government** and **Digital Society**,
    involving the public, private and people sectors. This means every
    industry, business and government agency stepping up to accelerate
    its digitalisation efforts, to build capabilities and solutions that
    will propel the nation forward. This whole-of-nation movement will
    be powered by a society of digitally ready citizens and communities,
    confident and eager to learn about and adopt digital technologies.

16. Strong **System Foundations** must be in place. Cybersecurity will
    be the bedrock to secure all our digital efforts. We need a robust
    and flexible data management systems and processes to ensure secure
    data sharing for policymaking, service delivery and operations.
    Singapore also needs to invest in digital infrastructure to enable
    the full-scale industrialisation of digital technologies and reap
    maximum efficiencies and benefits.

17. We will level up our **People and Culture** to best capture this
    opportunity. Talent has always been Singapore's advantage. As a
    nation, we are renewing our emphasis on building a technology
    culture. Individuals will need to foster a mind-set of lifelong
    learning to embrace change and strengthen our capabilities.
    Organisations will need to rethink their operating models to be more
    agile and bold. As a nation, we will need to strengthen our
    collaborations with the world. Every member of society must benefit
    from the opportunities and advancements that a Smart Nation will
    bring.

18. This effort will be exemplified by a portfolio of major national
    **Projects**, in areas such as digital infrastructure and service
    delivery. Our measure of success how individuals and businesses are
    better served and better empowered to achieve their own success.
    Each project will involve the public, private and people sectors
    working closely to collectively transform Singapore.

Digital Society]{.underline}

19. To facilitate the transformation of Singapore, the government has
    outlined broad plans to transform our Economy, Government and
    Society through the **Digital Economy Framework for Action, Digital
    Government Blueprint,** and the **Digital Readiness Blueprint**. A
    Digital Government will provide the environment and drive enablers
    to shape the Digital Economy and a Digital Society. A Digital
    Economy will work closely with Digital Government to support the
    digitalisation of Government service delivery and build industry
    capability for future transformation needs. We are also doing
    further work to develop a holistic approach to cultivate a Digital
    Society which is confident to harness technology.

***Digital Economy***

20. Going digital is a national imperative for a better future for
    Singaporeans. Digitalisation is about enabling new possibilities
    across the economy, with business growth and better jobs. Grasping
    these opportunities will allow Singapore to remain a smart and
    thriving nation that continually attracts investments and talents to
    her shores. The Singapore Digital (SG:D) movement was launched to
    spur our digitalization efforts, with the Government, companies,
    organisations and individuals to reap the benefits of a digital
    economy. Our vision is to be a leading digital economy that
    continually reinvents itself.

21. We do this via accelerating the digital transformation of existing
    economic sectors, fostering new ecosystems enabled by digital
    technologies, and developing a next-generation digital industry in
    sectors such as cybersecurity as an engine of growth. This is
    outlined in the **Digital Economy Framework for Action** by the
    Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).

|                                                                       |
| **1. Accelerate:** To accelerate the digitalisation of our existing   |
| industries for productivity improvements, efficiency gains and new    |
| revenue opportunities                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| Our economic agencies have a bold vision of digitalizing every        |
| industry and every business, raising productivity and efficiencies to |
| grow the economy. In 2017, the Government rolled out 23 **Industry    |
| Transformation Maps (ITMs)** as part of the efforts under the         |
| Committee of Future Economy. Supporting these ITMs are Industry       |
| Digital Plans to facilitate digitalisation in selected industries.    |
|                                                                       |
| Our SMEs are an important foundation of the economy. The **SMEs Go    |
| Digital** programme helps to make going digital simple for SMEs. The  |
| Industry Digital Plans for SMEs (IDPs), which are aligned to the      |
| Industry Transformation Maps, provide SMEs with step-by-step guidance |
| on the digital technologies to use at each stage of their growth --   |
| SMEs can self-assess their digital readiness, seek advice on their    |
| digitalisation journey, deploy curated solutions, participate in      |
| industry-led pilot projects and engage project management services to |
| implement their digital projects.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| In addition, IMDA is working with businesses and government agencies  |
| on impactful projects that can accelerate the pace of digital change  |
| for industry sectors. These include innovative concepts in urban      |
| logistics such as federated lockers for more convenient last mile     |
| delivery, the Kampong Glam precinct-level transformation, and the     |
| **Punggol Digital District** which will be a vibrant and inclusive    |
| district underpinned by cutting edge technology and a hub for key     |
| growth sectors of the Digital Economy.                                |
|                                                                       |
| **2. Compete:** To enhance our economic competitiveness by fostering  |
| new integrated ecosystems converged around customers' needs.          |
|                                                                       |
| Digitalisation is hastening the blurring of sector boundaries.        |
| Enabled by digital platforms, customers can increasingly dictate how  |
| products and services are designed and delivered around their needs,  |
| resulting in the formation of new business ecosystems and market      |
| intermediaries. These new ecosystems will form the foundation of      |
| future industries. Singapore aims to foster a conducive environment   |
| for the growth of such integrated ecosystems and support our          |
| businesses                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| to innovate and evolve their business models, and become competitive  |
| in the global marketplace.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| To do so, we will support the innovation ecosystem, such as through   |
| the **Open Innovation Platform** (OIP). With the support of a         |
| structured innovation process, the OIP facilitates collaboration      |
| between problem owners and Infocomm Media (ICM) companies to          |
| accelerate the development of innovative, new and scalable solutions  |
| that address real business problems.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| **3. Transform:** To develop the next generation digital industry as  |
| an engine of growth for the economy, and a driver of digitalisation   |
| across all industries.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| Last, but not least, we want to transform the ICM industry to be a    |
| key growth driver of Singapore's digital economy. IMDA will continue  |
| in this area and create digital companies and capabilities of the     |
| future. As a nation, we are building deep capabilities in four        |
| frontier technology sectors -- Data Science and Artificial            |
| Intelligence (AI), Cybersecurity, Immersive Media as well as Internet |
| of Things (IOT) and Future Communications Infrastructure.             |
|                                                                       |
| **Accreditation\@SG:D** aims to level the playing field for promising |
| Singapore-based technology companies to win projects, grow and        |
| compete in the global market by helping them establish their          |
| credentials and facilitating access to Government and large           |
| enterprise buyers. It gives accredited companies the opportunity to   |
| be better-recognised overseas with a trusted Singapore branding. The  |
| Government will also facilitate overseas growth of Singapore          |
| companies through                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| targeted programmes for Singapore enterprises, in collaboration with  |
| agencies such as Enterprise Singapore.                                |
|                                                                       |
| The **Singapore Economic Development Board**, **Enterprise            |
| Singapore**, and **Infocomm Media Development Authority** will        |
| jointly take the lead in engaging leading digital companies globally  |
| and grooming Singapore-based digital companies, to create good jobs,  |
| accelerate the building of capabilities and encourage technology      |
| collaborations in our local ecosystem.                                |
|                                                                       |
| In addition, four cross-cutting enablers will support these pillars   |
| of growth:                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| • **Talent:** To continually up-skill, re-skill and raise the digital |
| capabilities of the workforce.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| • **Research and Innovation:** For firms to innovate and leverage     |
| intellectual property for competitive advantage, harnessing the       |
| capabilities in our research and innovation community.                |
|                                                                       |
| • **Policy, Regulations and Standards:** To ensure that our policy    |
| and regulatory environment, including the environment for data        |
| innovation, is globally competitive in a digital world.               |
|                                                                       |
| • **Physical and Digital Infrastructure:** To ensure that             |

***Digital Government***

22. The Singapore Government endeavours to build leaner and stronger
    public agencies which are digital to the core, at the global leading
    edge of service delivery, transformation and innovation. The
    government will empower public servants to continue to serve with
    heart, commanding strong public trust, confidence and support.
    Outlining the strategies and desired outcomes for this
    transformation is the **Digital Government Blueprint** by the Smart
    Nation and Digital Government Group.

| The Singapore government is bold and committed in its ambition to     |
| transform itself. The **Digital Government Blueprint** is only the    |
| first statement of intent to enable a public service that is leaner   |
| and stronger, with skilled and adaptable officers at the leading edge |
| of service delivery and innovation. It spells out how we will         |
| organise ourselves around our mission and stakeholders, rather than   |
| be bound by organisational boundaries and processes.                  |
|                                                                       |
| At the same time, we are undergoing a fundamental overhaul of our     |
| technology infrastructure to operate more nimbly and effectively, not |
| unlike the digital giants of the world. We are moving towards a       |
| government that is able to leverage data, cloud computing and a       |
| micro-services architecture by building a **Singapore Government Tech |
| Stack**. We are also making strategic bets in frontier technologies   |
| like artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure that our digital and      |
| physical systems are intelligent to the core. This re-engineering of  |
| our technical infrastructure will allow the Government to more        |
| efficiently and effectively collaborate with the people and private   |
| sectors to deliver policies and services. At the same time, the       |
| Government is also rethinking its manpower and workforce strategies   |
| to grow our technology talent pool, incentivise for excellence and    |
| upskill public officers with data science and AI capabilities.        |
|                                                                       |
| The Digital Government Blueprint sets out bold targets to be achieved |
| by 2023:                                                              |
|                                                                       |

23. Together, the public and private sectors will drive **sectoral
    masterplans** in key domains and industry sectors. These will
    outline how technology will be used to improve lives and create new
    business opportunities. These include the **Industry Transformation
    Maps** as well as domain roadmaps in health, education, fintech,
    mobility and urban habitat.

***Digital Society***

24. In a Smart Nation, Singaporeans are empowered to maximise the
    opportunities and leverage conveniences of a digital society to lead
    meaningful lives. The Government will support this by making our
    services more accessible, raising our people's digital literacy, and
    encouraging people to participate in digital communities and
    platforms. To support this, the Ministry of Communications and
    Information has introduced a **Digital Readiness Blueprint**.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Digital Readiness Blueprint**                                       |
|                                                                       |
| Digital technologies can make our daily lives more convenient and     |
| sustainable, and they can also empower us to strengthen our community |
| bonds by enabling us to connect to and look out for one another. The  |
| Digital Readiness Blueprint, written with input from the people and   |
| private sectors, sets out recommendations for building Digital        |
| Readiness in Singapore, guided by four strategic thrusts:             |
|                                                                       |
| -   Expand and Enhance Digital Access for Inclusivity                 |
|                                                                       |
| -   Infuse Digital Literacy into the National Consciousness           |
|                                                                       |
| -   Empower Community and Businesses to Drive Widespread Adoption of  |
|     Technology                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| -   Promote Digital Inclusion by Design                               |
|                                                                       |

| Guided by this framework, the blueprint offers 10 recommendations:    |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  Make access to basic digital enablers as widespread as possible   |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  Customise access package for those with specific needs            |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  Identify a set of basic digital skills for everyday activities to |
|     spur take up of digital technology, especially among the less     |
|     digitally savvy                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  Strengthen focus on information and media literacy to build       |
|     resilience in an era of online falsehoods.                        |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  Ensure that our children and youth grow up to form meaningful     |
|     relationships with people around them and use technology to       |
|     benefit their communities                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  Encourage private and people sector organisations to amplify      |
|     efforts and help more Singaporeans adopt technology               |
|                                                                       |
| 7.  Provide one-on-one assistance to make it easy for Singaporeans to |
|     adopt technology, especially those who find it challenging        |
|                                                                       |
| 8.  Provide support for projects that create opportunities for        |
|     community participation                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 9.  Encourage organisations to design for inclusion                   |
|                                                                       |
| 10. Reach out to more Singaporeans by ensuring that relevant digital  |
|     services are made available in vernacular languages               |
|                                                                       |

25. As more public and private sector services go digital, we will all
    be nudged into increasingly digital behaviours. While we acknowledge
    that there are fears and anxieties surrounding the use technology,
    the speed at which we become a Digital Society is dependent on how
    quickly we are able to adapt. We must recognize how our daily
    digital behaviour contributes to better policy insights and service
    delivery, and actively work towards being digital individuals.

26. At the same time, rapid developments in digital technologies will
    have an impact on our society, such as how we relate to each other
    and to our institutions. Technology has the potential to influence
    where individuals spend their time and bring communities together to
    support causes. Our work on building a Digital Society will need to
    take into account how technology can unite rather than divide, and
    how society as a whole can be more resilient and adaptable to
    change. Building upon the Digital Readiness Blueprint, we will do
    further work to develop a holistic approach to build a Digital
    Society.

27. Strong and secure foundations in cybersecurity, as well as data and
    digital infrastructure, are essential to driving whole-of-nation
    transformation across economy, government and society.

[]{#_Toc524727841 .anchor}*Ensuring reliable and secure cyber
foundations*

28. As more services and transactions take place online amidst
    persistent cyber threats, it becomes even more important that they
    are digitally secure and reliable. Singapore has always prioritised
    cybersecurity in our Smart Nation journey. The Cybersecurity Agency
    of Singapore was formed in 2015 to provide centralised oversight of
    national cybersecurity functions. The **Singapore Cybersecurity
    Strategy** was published in 2016, outlining priorities to build a
    resilient infrastructure, create a safer cyber space, develop a
    vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem and strengthen international
    partnerships. We have also developed cybersecurity plans in 11
    Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors.

29. Some initiatives under the Strategy that provide this secure
    foundation include enacting the **Cybersecurity Act** and conducting
    the **CII Protection Programme** to raise cyber readiness in our
    critical sectors. This helps protect CII, which when compromised
    would have a debilitating impact on the delivery of essential
    services and the Singapore economy. With inter-dependencies of
    global trade and financial markets today, these attacks could also
    have serious spill-over effects on other countries. As such, CSA
    also champions regional cyber capacity building initiatives, such as
    the **ASEAN CERT Incident Drill (ACID)**, and the **ASEAN Cyber
    Capacity Programme (ACCP)**.

30. For Smart Nation projects, SNDGG and the Cybersecurity Agency of
    Singapore (CSA) also work closely through the **Smart Nation
    Cybersecurity Committee (SNCC)** to ensure security-by-design, where
    cybersecurity is incorporated from the onset. This includes
    providing guidance on security principles, design and
    implementation, and approving design trade-offs based on the
    relevant threat-risk assessments. CSA is also spearheading efforts
    with other international government agencies, research institutes
    and industry, to drive a global effort to secure the Internet of
    Things (IoT) through an **International IoT Security Initiative**.

[]{#_Toc524727842 .anchor}*Maximising the value of data in a trusted
environment*

31. Data is a key resource in Smart Nation. It will enable our
    businesses to grow and create new business opportunities, and allow
    Government to have more informed policymaking, service delivery and
    operations. Singapore will be a global hub for data, akin to our
    world-class airport and seaport. Data will form a key foundation
    upon which we derive insights and build intelligent systems.

32. Our public and private sector organisations will need to develop the
    systems, processes, and capabilities to maximise the value of data.
    In many organisations, there is often a lack of awareness on how
    data can be used, how to improve the quantity and quality of
    datasets, and how to fuse data from different sources for new
    insights.

33. The Government is leading the way to facilitate effective data
    sharing between public agencies, to support data-driven
    policymaking, operations and service delivery. To do this,
    government data will be organised around an Integrated Data
    Management Framework under centralised oversight of the Government
    Data Office. This establishes new ways of managing and using data
    across the four-stage lifecycle of acquisition, fusion, access and
    distribution and exploitation, across four key domains of
    individual, company, geospatial and sensors.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Shifts in the Government Data Strategy**                            |
|                                                                       |
| Government data will be organised around a new Integrated Data        |
| Management Framework, including reviewing legislation, implementing   |
| policy, and building capabilities and shared services.                |
|                                                                       |
| This will achieve system outcomes, such as:                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  Reducing the time and resources expended by individual source     |
|     agencies to clean and verify acquired data for different data     |
|     requestors.                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  Restricting the fusion of datasets to specific centres for data   |
|     protection, and efficiency in distributing fit-for-purpose data   |
|     sets to users.                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  Allowing the expeditious access to data and analytics             |
|     capabilities for policy analysis, operations, service delivery    |
|     and private sector facilitation.                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

34. Where there is public interest and benefit to Singapore and
    Singaporeans, the Government will also share Government-verified
    data with the private sector, such as via the **MyInfo** platform as
    part of the National Digital Identity project. We are also scaling
    up our open data initiative with better organization and more
    datasets on data.gov.sg for citizens and communities to co-create
    and leverage on.

35. For the private sector, we have set up a **Data Innovation Programme
    Office** to advise companies how to better harness data, and to
    encourage data-driven innovation projects. Working with industry
    leads, it will scale up data collaboration efforts, which allows
    companies to share data securely and access data analytics tools.
    Together with the Personal Data Protection Commission, regulatory
    support and clarity is provided through practical guidance and
    regulatory sandbox. This will help facilitate data sharing
    arrangements that have benefits to the public.

36. At the same time, we recognise that our continued ability to harness
    data to drive better service delivery and economic dynamism is
    premised on continued trust by our businesses and people, that data
    will be shared and used in a way that respects confidentiality and
    privacy. A trusted digital environment is key to confidence and
    participation in a Smart Nation. Hence, our laws and policies must
    therefore ensure proper safeguards to protect personal data, while
    promoting sharing and innovation. In order to support businesses in
    building consumer trust, IMDA has also developed the **Data
    Protection Trustmark** certification to help businesses verify their
    conformance to personal data protection standards and best
    practices. DPTM certification provides validation of an
    organisation's data protection regime, thereby strengthening its
    reputation and raising its business competitiveness.

37. The **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA**), enacted in 2012,
    outlines a baseline standard of protection for personal data across
    the economy. The Government is currently reviewing the PDPA to
    ensure that our regulatory environment keeps pace with the evolving
    needs of organisations and individuals in a digital economy, and
    enables the legitimate use of personal data while safeguarding
    consumers' trust.

38. To provide greater safeguards and clarity regarding the use of data
    by and within the public sector, a new **Public Sector (Governance)
    Act** was enacted in 2018 to ensure that data can be shared in a
    safe, responsible and appropriate manner. Going forward, the
    Government will also work towards the establishment of new
    governance frameworks and guidelines on the use of artificial
    intelligence. We will continue to work on data protection
    accreditation frameworks, advisory guidelines and tools to help
    organisations, as well as participate in international and regional
    mechanisms to promote cross-border data flows.

[]{#_Toc524727843 .anchor}*Developing next-generation digital
infrastructure to catalyse widespread digitalisation*

39. Singapore will develop next-generation digital infrastructure that
    forms the foundation of our Smart Nation, building on our earlier
    investments in connectivity and Internet penetration. Innovative
    products and services can be built on top of this infrastructure.

40. We will further enhance connectivity infrastructure, particularly
    for mobile and IoT devices. The telcos will roll out **5G mobile
    networks** approximately by 2020, and have already announced plans
    for **national NB-IoT networks**. We are expanding the coverage of
    fibre broadband and **Wireless\@SG**, to ensure that every person
    and business has access to high speed Internet. To improve our
    connectivity with the rest of the world, we will continue to
    **strengthen Singapore's position as a global digital hub.**

41. We will accelerate the development of national digital platforms
    that serve the needs of the both Digital Economy and Digital
    Government, starting with the Strategic National Projects (SNPs) --
    **National Digital Identity (NDI)**, **E-payments** and the **Smart
    Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP)**. These are enabling platforms and
    infrastructure that will benefit multiple stakeholders -- the
    private sector, citizens and also multiple Government agencies --
    and enable the further development of digital services. The
    Government plays a key role in developing these platforms, including
    setting standards, ensuring interoperable platforms, leading
    adoption initiatives and engaging the public on the use of such
    platforms, and will partner the private sector to do so. (More on
    NDI, E-payments and SNSP can be found in the Projects section.)
    Singapore has also adopted the **Pan European Public Procurement
    On-Line (PEPPOL) standard** for nation-wide e-invoicing, which is
    being driven by both the public and private sector.

42. One of the strategies to achieve Digital Government is to build
    common digital and data platforms. Private sector companies such as
    Amazon, Google and Dropbox utilise an organisation-wide technology
    stack, which is a bundle of software components used in building
    digital applications. The **Singapore Government Tech Stack** will
    outline the on-premise hosting platforms, middleware, micro-services
    and standards/tools needed to form a full suite of services for
    agencies' use. This will empower agencies to better design
    applications and services around the needs of citizens and
    businesses to support our digitalisation efforts, while paving the
    way for closer collaboration between the private and public sector
    to share data and build services for citizens and businesses.

43. Digital infrastructure will also allow Singapore to build upon our
    existing strengths in connectivity and trade. Sectoral platforms
    such as the **National Trade Platform** facilitate obtaining
    regulatory approval from Singapore authorities, sharing information
    between companies, and for firms to offer supporting services like
    trade financing, insurance and forwarding. Such projects will allow
    businesses to transact with one another in a seamless and paperless
    manner, throughout the value chain, including for cross-border
    transactions.

[]{#_Toc524727844 .anchor}[People and Culture]{.underline}

44. To effectively harness the power of digital infrastructure, data and
    to ensure cybersecurity, we will need to support our people to be
    Smart Nation-ready by inculcating new mind-sets and promoting
    upskilling.

[]{#_Toc524727845 .anchor}*Promoting an innovation and technology
culture*

45. As individuals, we need to consider two key shifts. First, a shift
    from linear pathways of education employment, to needing an attitude
    of **lifelong learning and upskilling**. In the past, once a person
    had a good education, he would most likely be prepared for his
    career and the rest of his life. Today, that concept has been
    disrupted by the necessity for lifelong learning, especially with
    technology. Every job of the future will evolve with technological
    change and require a higher level of digital literacy.

46. Second, individuals need to shift in from being a consumer to an
    **active co-creator and contributor**. The Government cannot, and
    should not be the solution to all problems. In many ways,
    individuals are already actively using digital tools to shape their
    communities. For example, many informal WhatsApp and Facebook groups
    bring individuals together to rally around specific causes. Civic
    and community groups can harness open data and APIs on data.gov.sg
    to co-create new solutions and work with Government to serve needs
    and advance causes.

47. Our companies and institutions, no matter how large or small, can no
    longer operate business-as-usual. We will need to aspire to be
    "intelligent to the core" and strengthen integration between
    business operations, people and technology. Organisations need to
    think deeply about how to be **mission and customer-centric**, and
    prioritise investing in capabilities to manage their data and
    digital systems effectively and securely. Technologies like cloud
    computing and AI will fundamentally shift business operations, and
    organisations will need to rethink how it builds capabilities for
    its people and systems in tandem.

48. As a nation, we need to have a **"dare to try" mind-set** and be
    open to experiment with new ideas and take manageable risks. At the
    same time, we must be willing to embrace failure -- fail fast and
    learn quickly, and have the resilience to bounce back and try again.
    The Government will lead by example by allowing more flexibility in
    resource allocation for technology projects and public sector
    innovation. To support industry, the Government will also adopt a
    balanced regulatory approach to support innovation, and step in only
    when needed in the public interest, such as for consumer safety,
    public interest or in ensuring the stability of national systems.
    Regulatory sandboxes and test-beds have already been set up to
    support innovation in areas such as drones, autonomous vehicles and
    fintech, to facilitate innovation while providing the Government the
    time to better understand the potential of the technologies
    alongside the innovation process.

49. We should also focus on **strengthening Singapore's relationship
    with the world**. Technology increasingly transcends borders and the
    acceleration of technological change enhances the benefits and
    dangers of globalisation. Singapore has the unique opportunity of
    being a Global-Asia node for technology and innovation. At the same
    time, we will need to collaborate closely with our regional and
    global partners, as well as Singaporeans abroad, to build common
    digital infrastructure and norms.

50. Today, our schools nurture our students to thrive in a
    rapidly-changing world by developing confident, independent learners
    who have the skills and heart to contribute back to their
    communities. These skills are captured in the **21^st^ Century
    Competencies** framework. We will also consider how to prepare our
    population to think computationally in the digital age, and
    continually review school curriculum and programmes to ensure
    relevance to the future workplace and society.

[]{#_Toc524727846 .anchor}*Building a digitally-ready workforce to seize
new opportunities*

51. Singapore needs to have a ready pool of skilled ICT manpower, who
    can help companies and the Government seize opportunities in
    digitalisation as and when they arise. At the same time, as the use
    of digital technologies becomes more pervasive, today's working
    population would need to reskill to be ready for jobs in a digital
    age.

52. Central to this effort is the national **SkillsFuture** movement. As
    part of SkillsFuture, tripartite partners have established the
    **TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA)**, which offers various programmes
    to cultivate digital leaders, upskill our ICT workforce and to
    support non-ICT professionals who wish to transit to the ICT sector.
    Another programme is the **SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace**,
    aimed at equipping all Singaporeans with the mind-set and basic
    functional skills for the future economy. Businesses will need to
    prioritise upskilling their employees, and individuals are
    encouraged to cultivate a habit of lifelong learning. The Government
    will similarly put in place programmes to raise the **digital
    literacy of public officers**, with a goal of training 20,000 public
    officers in data analytics and data science by 2023.

53. To strengthen in-house digital capabilities in the public sector, we
    have established a **Centre of Excellence for ICT and Smart Systems
    (ICT&SS)** in GovTech. The Centre of Excellence houses capability
    centres in Data Science and AI, Sensors and IoT, ICT Infrastructure,
    Applications Development, Cybersecurity and Geospatial Technology,
    and will support the rest of Government in building technical
    capabilities. To groom more technology leaders, we are also
    reviewing our public sector leadership schemes to establish
    **clearer career pathways for ICT&SS talent** to meet their
    aptitudes and aspirations, and are also introducing a
    **Government-wide ICT&SS scheme of service**, as a means to enhance
    the Government ICT&SS career proposition. The recently launched
    **Smart Nation Scholarship** signals our commitment to growing
    technology expertise in the public sector. To optimise the
    deployment of our technical talent, and achieve greater
    interoperability and economies of scale of digital systems, we are
    also **strengthening functional leadership for the ICT&SS
    profession** to better coordinate the efforts of the community
    across the whole-of-Government.

54. Our economic agencies will continue to support multinational
    corporations and local enterprises to ensure that Singapore remains
    an attractive place for top international talent and firms to
    relocate here, and for overseas Singaporeans to return home.
    Especially for fields where talent is scarce, we will review talent
    attraction schemes and create meaningful work for to attract top
    talent, which will in turn support native capability building. To
    leverage expertise outside of Government, the **Smart Nation
    Fellowship** brings top data scientists and technologists to
    Singapore to collaborate with the Government on specific projects
    for short to medium-term stints.

55. If we can do all these right, we can get the right mix of local and
    foreign talent to make Singapore a creative, fertile innovative and
    enterprising environment.

[]{#_Toc524727847 .anchor}*Ensuring everyone benefits from Smart Nation*

56. In a Smart Nation, everyone will benefit. Technology will be so
    seamlessly integrated in our infrastructure and institutions,
    everyone, regardless of technological ability would enjoy
    significant improvements in day-to-day living. For example, sensors
    can help detect when an elderly person has fallen down and alert the
    relevant personnel, without him or her having to actually operate
    technology.

57. Technology also has the power to be a social leveller. Hence, we
    need to dedicate resources to ensure that all Singaporeans,
    including the vulnerable, such as the elderly, low-income and
    persons with disabilities, are able to seize the opportunities
    offered by digital technologies.

58. The Government will work closely together with the people and
    private sectors to deliver on the **Digital Readiness Blueprint,**
    which outlines initiatives to help all Singaporeans, regardless of
    age or ability, to have digital access and literacy to participate
    in Smart Nation. For example, we will look into how we can enhance
    our support for vulnerable segments to have basic digital enablers,
    including internet connectivity and smart devices. Already,
    initiatives like the **Home Access Programme** and **Enable IT
    programme** are proactively supporting segments in need.

59. The Government will also work with tripartite partners to raise
    digital service standards and establish digital concierge-like
    services and digital clinics in the community, to assist those who
    are less comfortable with technology wth using digital services.
    Businesses and individuals can volunteer with **IMDA's Silver
    Infocomm Initiative** to help bridge the digital divide among
    seniors (aged 50 years and above), and empower seniors to live a
    digital lifestyle for greater convenience and to connect to the
    community. IMDA has also rolled out a Basic Digital Skills
    curriculum which articulates a set of basic digital skills everyone
    needs to enjoy greater convenience and participate meaningfully in a
    Digital Society.

60. The Government will also uphold the principle of digital inclusion
    by design, ensuring that all products and services align with
    international accessibility standards, and encouraging businesses to
    do likewise. The Government will constantly review its Digital
    Service Standards to ensure that its digital standards and design
    principles are inclusive.

61. Beyond this, the Government will support digital projects and that
    create opportunities for community participation, as well as
    ground-up efforts that encourage more Singaporeans to adopt
    technology.

[]{#_Toc524727848 .anchor}[Smart Nation Projects]{.underline}

62. When we have talented, hardworking enterprising people able to work
    effectively with data and digital platforms in multi-disciplinary
    teams, Singapore will see Smart Nation delivered through a portfolio
    of digital projects. These will manifest in digital interactions
    that will not only enhance daily living, but also build comparative
    advantages for Singapore.

63. Strategic National Projects will demonstrate the pervasive impact of
    digital technologies, and involve close collaboration across public,
    private and people sectors. In addition, the Digital Government
    Blueprint has set out targets for Government agencies to deliver
    projects in the fields of data analytics and AI, with an emphasis on
    cross-agency collaboration and transformative impact.

64. Globally, we are at the cusp of a revolution, and in Singapore, at a
    pivotal moment in nation-building. Although digital technologies
    will accelerate the clock speed of change, the impact and
    consequences of how technology will impact life as we know it will
    take time to unfold.

65. Smart Nation was launched in November 2014, and we are only in the
    early days of the digital revolution and our Smart Nation
    initiative. The effects of this digital era may not always seem
    revolutionary in the short term, but we can expect fundamental
    changes to society and economy in the decades to come, changes as
    profound as those resulting from electricity and the combustion
    engine of previous industrial revolutions.

66. Beyond delivering on the future we can foresee, Singapore must
    continue to push ahead in this fast-moving space, to continually
    innovate and transform ourselves, and strengthen our capabilities
    and expertise so that we are prepared for the unknown. We have to
    boost our technological capabilities to overcome physical and
    manpower constraints. To achieve this, Singapore needs to continue
    to strengthen the nexus between academia, industry and Government,
    make strategic bets in frontier technologies and form strong
    relationships with the international community to secure our future.

[]{#_Toc524727850 .anchor}[Strengthening the
academia-industry-Government nexus]{.underline}

67. Singapore has always believed in research, innovation and enterprise
    as cornerstones of our national strategy. We will need to continue
    to strengthen the nexus between academia and research centres and
    industry, to unlock economic potential. The Government These in turn
    are aligned with national priorities to tackle Singapore's national
    challenges, such as improving healthcare and transforming our urban
    landscape for greater liveability and sustainability.

68. Public investment in research and innovation has continued to grow
    over the last 25 years. Most recently, the Government set aside
    S\$400 million to support Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE)
    in the Services and Digital Economy strategic technology domain from
    2016 to 2020 under the **RIE 2020 Masterplan**. The domain includes
    programmes to drive digital innovation in urban mobility, healthcare
    ICT, and services productivity. It will also support the building of
    capabilities in AI, IoT and cybersecurity.

69. Singapore's universities have also steadily risen up in global
    rankings and improved their research influence internationally.
    Singapore has attracted top research scientists and has strong
    partnerships with global research centres. We need to continue to
    ensure that these investments in R&D catalyse new economic activity.

70. To develop a vibrant startup ecosystem to leverage these
    opportunities, the Government has established the **Startup SG**
    programme which provides comprehensive support in areas such as
    funding, mentorship, talent attraction and internationalisation,
    among others. The public and private sector will work closer than
    ever to foster a strong ecosystem that attracts the top talent and
    capital, which allows the most innovative ideas to thrive.

[]{#_Toc524727851 .anchor}[Make strategic bets in artificial
intelligence and other frontier technologies]{.underline}

71. Singapore will also need to continue to be at the forefront of the
    latest technologies, and chart new frontiers for Smart Nation. One
    such area is in intelligent systems powered by artificial
    intelligence (AI).

72. Intelligent Systems provide us an opportunity to overcome our
    population and workforce constraints by generating quantum leaps in
    productivity and efficiency, through automation and augmenting human
    physical and cognitive abilities. AI will also pervasively transform
    every aspect of how we live, work and play by enabling
    personalisation and anticipatory services.

73. Singapore has started to make significant investments to drive
    development and adoption of AI. Singapore is investing up to \$150
    million over five years in research through **AI Singapore**, to use
    AI to solve major challenges that affect society and industry. This
    is done through the Grand Challenges, investing in deep capabilities
    to catch the next wave of scientific innovation and broadening
    adoption and use of AI within industry through the 100 Experiments
    initiative. The **AI Business Partnership Programme** also
    encourages and facilitates AI adoption among businesses in Singapore
    through pairing end user companies with AI solution providers. The
    Government is also making plans to develop digital infrastructure
    and ensure that its agencies are AI-ready, as well as ensuring that
    the talent attraction and manpower policies are in place to develop
    deep capabilities in Singapore. The Government is also proactively
    seeking use cases for the deployment of AI, and has committed to at
    least one AI project per Ministry Family by 2023.

74. At the same time, we are also conscious that AI will disrupt
    society, as well as precipitate new challenges in ethics and
    governance. Hence, we will take a balanced and pragmatic approach to
    build a trusted ecosystem to drive AI development and adoption. IMDA
    has published a discussion paper on what a possible AI governance
    framework might look like, set up initiatives such as the **Advisory
    Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data** to promote responsible
    development and deployment of AI by businesses, and the **Research
    Programme on the Governance of AI and Data** to develop local
    capabilities to understand and mitigate AI risks. IMDA has also
    started a Regulators Roundtable - a community of practice among
    sector regulators to co-ordinate and align AI regulatory approach.
    Regulators for private sectors will adapt the reference AI
    governance framework in the development of their sector-specific
    frameworks. Government sector will also incorporate the discussion
    paper in developing an AI governance framework for the public
    sector.

| -   The **Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data**,       |
|     announced on 5 June 2018, is an industry-led initiative to        |
|     examine legal and ethical issues raised by commercial deployment  |
|     of AI, to encourage industry to develop and adopt AI technologies |
|     in an accountable and responsible manner. This will help to       |
|     foster consumer understanding and trust, which is necessary for   |
|     the important innovations that will grow our economy and improve  |
|     lives. In the course of its work, the Advisory Council will       |
|     assist the Government to develop voluntary codes of practice to   |
|     guide corporate decision makers, serve as a barometer of          |
|     consumers' acceptance of innovative data use, and make            |

| -   The **Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data** has   |
|     been set up following the award of a five-year research grant     |
|     from the National Research Foundation to the Singapore Management |
|     University in June 2018. The goals of the Research Programme are  |
|     to develop international thought leadership and advance           |
|     scholarship and discourse in legal, regulatory, ethical and       |
|     policy issues arising from the use of AI and data. This is done   |

|     and activities.                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

75. Singaporeans will also get to pick up artificial intelligence basics
    with an **AI for Everyone (AI4E)** programme to help familiarise
    them with AI and help them understand how it can be used in their
    daily lives.

76. There are many frontier technologies that are still evolving every
    day. We have only begun to make forays as a nation in the emerging
    technologies of Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems,
    blockchain, Augmented and Virtual Reality, as well as quantum
    computing. The technologies once found in science fiction are
    starting to materialise, and experiences that we could only once
    dream of are becoming reality. Our challenge is to be alive to the
    possibilities and take practical steps to channel these technologies
    to ensure the continued prosperity of Singapore.

[]{#_Toc524727852 .anchor}[Strengthen Singapore's collaboration with the
international community]{.underline}

*Strengthening Singapore's connectivity with the world*

77. Singapore has thrived as a transport and logistics hub with a
    world-class airport and port, physically connected to the world. To
    respond nimbly to a rapidly changing world, Singapore needs to drive
    seamless online-offline connectivity, to make Singapore a desired
    hub for critical trade and information flows. Singapore will
    continue to invest in digital infrastructure and programmes with our
    regional and international partners, layering on digital services to
    deepen our physical connectivity.

78. In addition to physical connectivity, Singapore also participates in
    the **APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) and Privacy Recognition
    for Processors (PRP)** **Systems**. The APEC CBPR/PRP Systems
    provide the participants an avenue for cross-border data transfers
    as they all adhere to an APEC-approved standard set of certification
    requirements. This reduces the challenge of organisations having to
    comply with multiple systems of domestic laws when they operate in
    multiple APEC Economies. Companies that achieve APEC CBPR or PRP
    certifications will be differentiated as trusted data processors
    that adhere to regionally approved and recognised data protection
    standards.

*Sharing best practices and exchange of ideas*

79. Singapore will also continue to be an active player in regional and
    international technology conferences, contributing to discussions,
    thought leadership and scholarship around technology regulation and
    norms. We actively welcome international counterparts to visit and
    co-organise activities and exchanges.

*Building long-term relationships to address shared challenges*

80. As technology develops, new challenges common to all cities and
    countries will emerge. Singapore will continue to strengthen our
    relationship with regional and international partners to work
    closely on global challenges, such as achieving the Sustainable
    Development Goals and cyber defence.

82. The digital revolution can either be exhilarating or terrifying, or
    both. It depends on whether we are ready. Either way, it will be
    necessary to keep Singapore an exceptional nation. That is why we
    have embarked on Smart Nation, and should continue to drive it with
    a great sense of urgency.

83. The Government will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure,
    create open platforms, share open data, encourage our businesses to
    adopt the latest technologies and facilitate skills upgrading and
    digital readiness for citizens.

84. Businesses will also need to rise to the occasion to make structural
    and financial investments in digital technologies, cultivating
    talents and shifting mind-sets that will be necessary for the
    future. Singaporeans must be flexible, eager to learn, and
    adventurous to venture beyond our shores.

85. The digital era is rapidly evolving, but we have never been better
    prepared to shape the future as we are now. Together, as a nation
    for our nation.
