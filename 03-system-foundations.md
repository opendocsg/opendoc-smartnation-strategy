# System Foundations

{:start="28"}

27. Strong and secure foundations in cybersecurity, as well as data and digital infrastructure, are essential to driving whole-of-nation transformation across economy, government and society.

## Ensuring reliable and secure cyber foundations

{:start="29"}

29.  As more services and transactions take place online amidst persistent cyber threats, it becomes even more important that they are digitally secure and reliable. Singapore has always prioritised cybersecurity in our Smart Nation journey. The Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore was formed in 2015 to provide centralised oversight of national cybersecurity functions. The **Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy** was published in 2016, outlining priorities to build a resilient infrastructure, create a safer cyber space, develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem and strengthen international partnerships. We have also developed cybersecurity plans in 11 Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors.

30.  Some initiatives under the Strategy that provide this secure foundation include enacting the **Cybersecurity Act** and conducting the **CII Protection Programme** to raise cyber readiness in our critical sectors. This helps protect CII, which when compromised would have a debilitating impact on the delivery of essential services and the Singapore economy. With inter-dependencies of global trade and financial markets today, these attacks could also have serious spill-over effects on other countries. As such, CSA also champions regional cyber capacity building initiatives, such as the **ASEAN CERT Incident Drill (ACID)**, and the **ASEAN Cyber Capacity Programme (ACCP)**.

31.  For Smart Nation projects, SNDGG and the Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA) also work closely through the **Smart Nation Cybersecurity Committee (SNCC)** to ensure security-by-design, where cybersecurity is incorporated from the onset. This includes providing guidance on security principles, design and implementation, and approving design trade-offs based on the relevant threat-risk assessments. CSA is also spearheading efforts with other international government agencies, research institutes and industry, to drive a global effort to secure the Internet of Things (IoT) through an **International IoT Security Initiative**.

## Key initiatives to ensure resilient, secure cyber foundations:

 - National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016
    -   Strengthen the resilience of our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)
    -   Mobilise businesses and the community to make cyberspace safer by countering cyber threats, combating cybercrime and protecting personal data
    -   Develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem comprising a skilled workforce, technology-advanced companies and strong research collaborations
    -   Step up efforts to forge strong international partnerships

- Cybersecurity Act 2018
    -   Legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of cybersecurity in Singapore
    -   Four objectives:
        -   Strengthen the protection of CII against cyber-attacks
        -   Authorize CSA to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents
        -   Establish a framework for sharing cybersecurity information
        -   Establish a light-touch licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers

## Maximising the value of data in a trusted environment

{:start="32"}

32.  Data is a key resource in Smart Nation. It will enable our businesses to grow and create new business opportunities, and allow Government to have more informed policymaking, service delivery and operations. Singapore will be a global hub for data, akin to our world-class airport and seaport. Data will form a key foundation upon which we derive insights and build intelligent systems. 

33.  Our public and private sector organisations will need to develop the systems, processes, and capabilities to maximise the value of data. In many organisations, there is often a lack of awareness on how data can be used, how to improve the quantity and quality of datasets, and how to fuse data from different sources for new insights. 

34.  The Government is leading the way to facilitate effective data sharing between public agencies, to support data-driven policymaking, operations and service delivery. To do this, government data will be organised around an Integrated Data Management Framework under centralised oversight of the Government Data Office. This establishes new ways of managing and using data across the four-stage lifecycle of acquisition, fusion, access and distribution and exploitation, across four key domains of individual, company, geospatial and sensors.

## Shifts in the Government Data Strategy

Government data will be organised around a new Integrated Data Management Framework, including reviewing legislation, implementing policy, and building capabilities and shared services.

This will achieve system outcomes, such as:
1.  Reducing the time and resources expended by individual source agencies to clean and verify acquired data for different data requestors.
2.  Restricting the fusion of datasets to specific centres for data protection, and efficiency in distributing fit-for-purpose data sets to users.
3.  Allowing the expeditious access to data and analytics capabilities for policy analysis, operations, service delivery and private sector facilitation.

35.  Where there is public interest and benefit to Singapore and Singaporeans, the Government will also share Government-verified data with the private sector, such as via the **MyInfo** platform as part of the National Digital Identity project. We are also scaling up our open data initiative with better organization and more datasets on data.gov.sg for citizens and communities to co-create and leverage on.

36.  For the private sector, we have set up a **Data Innovation Programme Office** to advise companies how to better harness data, and to encourage data-driven innovation projects. Working with industry leads, it will scale up data collaboration efforts, which allows companies to share data securely and access data analytics tools. Together with the Personal Data Protection Commission, regulatory support and clarity is provided through practical guidance and regulatory sandbox. This will help facilitate data sharing arrangements that have benefits to the public.

37.  At the same time, we recognise that our continued ability to harness data to drive better service delivery and economic dynamism is premised on continued trust by our businesses and people, that data will be shared and used in a way that respects confidentiality and privacy. A trusted digital environment is key to confidence and participation in a Smart Nation. Hence, our laws and policies must therefore ensure proper safeguards to protect personal data, while promoting sharing and innovation. In order to support businesses in building consumer trust, IMDA has also developed the **Data Protection Trustmark** certification to help businesses verify their conformance to personal data protection standards and best practices. DPTM certification provides validation of an organisation’s data protection regime, thereby strengthening its reputation and raising its business competitiveness.

38.  The **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)**, enacted in 2012, outlines a baseline standard of protection for personal data across the economy. The Government is currently reviewing the PDPA to ensure that our regulatory environment keeps pace with the evolving needs of organisations and individuals in a digital economy, and enables the legitimate use of personal data while safeguarding consumers’ trust.

39.  To provide greater safeguards and clarity regarding the use of data by and within the public sector, a new **Public Sector (Governance) Act** was enacted in 2018 to ensure that data can be shared in a safe, responsible and appropriate manner. Going forward, the Government will also work towards the establishment of new governance frameworks and guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence. We will continue to work on data protection accreditation frameworks, advisory guidelines and tools to help organisations, as well as participate in international and regional mechanisms to promote cross-border data flows.

### Key initiatives to maximize the value of data in a trusted environment:
-   MyInfo
-   Data Collaboratives
-   Personal Data Protection Act
-   Data Regulatory Sandbox
-   Data Protection Trustmark
-   Public Sector (Governance) Act

## Developing next-generation digital infrastructure to catalyse widespread digitalisation

{:start="40"}

40.  Singapore will develop next-generation digital infrastructure that forms the foundation of our Smart Nation, building on earlier investments in connectivity and Internet penetration. Innovative products and services can be built on top of this infrastructure. 

41.  We will further enhance connectivity infrastructure, particularly for mobile and IoT devices. The telcos will roll out **5G mobile networks** approximately by 2020, and have already announced plans for **national NB-IoT networks**. We are expanding the coverage of fibre broadband and **Wireless@SG**, to ensure that every person and business has access to high speed Internet. To improve our connectivity with the rest of the world, we will continue to **strengthen Singapore’s position as a global digital hub**.

42.  We will accelerate the development of national digital platforms that serve the needs of the both Digital Economy and Digital Government, starting with the Strategic National Projects (SNPs) – **National Digital Identity (NDI)**, **E-payments** and the **Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP)**. These are enabling platforms and infrastructure that will benefit multiple stakeholders – the private sector, citizens and also multiple Government agencies – and enable the further development of digital services. The Government plays a key role in developing these platforms, including setting standards, ensuring interoperable platforms, leading adoption initiatives and engaging the public on the use of such platforms, and will partner the private sector to do so. (More on NDI, E-payments and SNSP can be found in the Projects section.) Singapore has also adopted the **Pan European Public Procurement On-Line (PEPPOL) standard** for nation-wide e-invoicing, which is being driven by both the public and private sector.

43.  One of the strategies to achieve Digital Government is to build common digital and data platforms. Private sector companies such as Amazon, Google and Dropbox utilise an organisation-wide technology stack, which is a bundle of software components used in building digital applications. The **Singapore Government Tech Stack** will outline the on-premise hosting platforms, middleware, micro-services and standards/tools needed to form a full suite of services for agencies’ use. This will empower agencies to better design applications and services around the needs of citizens and businesses to support our digitalisation efforts, while paving the way for closer collaboration between the private and public sector to share data and build services for citizens and businesses.

### Singapore Government Tech Stack

<u>Layers</u>

On-premise hosting platforms used to host classified systems and data on Government-owned servers;

Middleware, which are software modules for common functions used in application development (such as centralised gateways to enable easy data sharing, automated functional testing of web and mobile applications);

Library of micro-services which will consolidate commonly-used micro-services so that agencies can consume and share them easily, ensuring commonality and inter-operability between agencies’ applications; and 

<u>Overarching Elements</u>

Standards and tools are overarching elements specific to the SGTS that will ensure alignment across all Government digital services, such as design standards for websites, guidelines for API design and workflow management tools.

{:start="44"}

44.  Digital infrastructure will also allow Singapore to build upon our existing strengths in connectivity and trade. Sectoral platforms such as the **National Trade Platform** facilitate obtaining regulatory approval from Singapore authorities, sharing information between companies, and for firms to offer supporting services like trade financing, insurance and forwarding. Such projects will allow businesses to transact with one another in a seamless and paperless manner, throughout the value chain, including for cross-border transactions.
