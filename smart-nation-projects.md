# Smart Nation Projects

{:start="62"}
62. When we have talented, hardworking enterprising people able to work effectively with data and digital platforms in multi-disciplinary teams, Singapore will see Smart Nation delivered through a portfolio of digital projects. These will manifest in digital interactions that will not only enhance daily living, but also build comparative advantages for Singapore.

63. Strategic National Projects will demonstrate the pervasive impact of digital technologies, and involve close collaboration across public, private and people sectors. In addition, the Digital Government Blueprint has set out targets for Government agencies to deliver projects in the fields of data analytics and AI, with an emphasis on cross-agency collaboration and transformative impact.

## Strategic National Projects

As part of the Smart Nation initiative, the Strategic National Projects (SNPs) are examples of digital transformation at the national scale. They all demonstrate a re-engineering and re-thinking of how we want to live, work and play in a Smart Nation. These Projects include: 

- The development of a National Digital Identity ecosystem to provide users with a single digital identity to transact with the Government and private sector organisations securely and conveniently.

- A greater push for E-Payments to enable citizens, businesses and Government agencies to make simple, safe and seamless digital payments, reducing the need to handle cash and cheques.

- Bundling together services and information from a citizen-centric lens and providing citizens with a digital way to transact high-touch services through the Moments of Life initiative. 

- The Smart Urban Mobility project leverages data and digital technologies, including artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, to further enhance the public transport commute.

- By building the Smart Nation Sensor Platform, Singapore will have an integrated nation-wide sensor platform to improve municipal services, city-level operations, planning and security. It will enable us to build and run a smarter, greener and liveable city. 

- The Digital Backbone is the basis of re-engineering the government through moving Government services to the commercial cloud, as well as implementing the Singapore Government Tech Stack and a new data paradigm. It enables Government to operate as One Public Service and match up to digital technology giants. 

We will continue to explore Strategic National Projects in key domains, such as healthcare and business productivity.

## Securing Our Future

{:start="64"}
64. Globally, we are at the cusp of a revolution, and in Singapore, at a pivotal moment in nation-building. Although digital technologies will accelerate the clock speed of change, the impact and consequences of how technology will impact life as we know it will take time to unfold.

65. Smart Nation was launched in November 2014, and we are only in the early days of the digital revolution and our Smart Nation initiative. The effects of this digital era may not always seem revolutionary in the short term, but we can expect fundamental changes to society and economy in the decades to come, changes as profound as those resulting from electricity and the combustion engine of previous industrial revolutions.

66. Beyond delivering on the future we can foresee, Singapore must continue to push ahead in this fast-moving space, to continually innovate and transform ourselves, and strengthen our capabilities and expertise so that we are prepared for the unknown. We have to boost our technological capabilities to overcome physical and manpower constraints. To achieve this, Singapore needs to continue to strengthen the nexus between academia, industry and Government, make strategic bets in frontier technologies and form strong relationships with the international community to secure our future.
