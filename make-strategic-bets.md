# Make strategic bets in artificial intelligence and other frontier technologies

71. Singapore will also need to continue to be at the forefront of the latest technologies, and chart new frontiers for Smart Nation. One such area is in intelligent systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI).

72. Intelligent Systems provide us an opportunity to overcome our population and workforce constraints by generating quantum leaps in productivity and efficiency, through automation and augmenting human physical and cognitive abilities. AI will also pervasively transform every aspect of how we live, work and play by enabling personalisation and anticipatory services.

73. Singapore has started to make significant investments to drive development and adoption of AI. Singapore is investing up to $150 million over five years in research through **AI Singapore**, to use AI to solve major challenges that affect society and industry. This is done through the Grand Challenges, investing in deep capabilities to catch the next wave of scientific innovation and broadening adoption and use of AI within industry through the 100 Experiments initiative. The **AI Business Partnership Programme** also encourages and facilitates AI adoption among businesses in Singapore through pairing end user companies with AI solution providers. The Government is also making plans to develop digital infrastructure and ensure that its agencies are AI-ready, as well as ensuring that the talent attraction and manpower policies are in place to develop deep capabilities in Singapore. The Government is also proactively seeking use cases for the deployment of AI, and has committed to at least one AI project per Ministry Family by 2023.

74. At the same time, we are also conscious that AI will disrupt society, as well as precipitate new challenges in ethics and governance. Hence, we will take a balanced and pragmatic approach to build a trusted ecosystem to drive AI development and adoption. IMDA has published a discussion paper on what a possible AI governance framework might look like, set up initiatives such as the **Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data** to promote responsible development and deployment of AI by businesses, and the **Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data** to develop local capabilities to understand and mitigate AI risks. IMDA has also started a Regulators Roundtable - a community of practice among sector regulators to co-ordinate and align AI regulatory approach.  Regulators for private sectors will adapt the reference AI governance framework in the development of their sector-specific frameworks. Government sector will also incorporate the discussion paper in developing an AI governance framework for the public sector.

### Government Efforts on AI Ethics and Governance

- **Discussion Paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Personal Data – Fostering Responsible Development and Adoption of AI** recommends two key principles:
    - Decisions made by or with the assistance of AI should be explainable, transparent and fair to consumers.
    - AI systems, robots and decisions should be human-centric.
    The discussion paper’s four-stage reference governance framework illustrates how these
    principles can be put into practice by different stakeholders. 

- The **Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data**, announced on 5 June 2018, is an industry-led initiative to examine legal and ethical issues raised by commercial deployment of AI, to encourage industry to develop and adopt AI technologies in an accountable and responsible manner. This will help to foster consumer understanding and trust, which is necessary for the important innovations that will grow our economy and improve lives. In the course of its work, the Advisory Council will assist the Government to develop voluntary codes of practice to guide corporate decision makers, serve as a barometer of consumers’ acceptance of innovative data use, and make recommendations on ethical and legal issues that may require policy or regulatory changes.

- The **Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data** has been set up following the award of a five-year research grant from the National Research Foundation  to the Singapore Management University in June 2018. The goals of the Research Programme are to develop international thought leadership and advance scholarship and discourse in legal, regulatory, ethical and policy issues arising from the use of AI and data. This is done through research publications and stakeholder engagement events and activities.

75. Singaporeans will also get to pick up artificial intelligence basics with an **AI for Everyone (AI4E)** programme to help familiarise them with AI and help them understand how it can be used in their daily lives.

76. There are many frontier technologies that are still evolving every day. We have only begun to make forays as a nation in the emerging technologies of Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, blockchain, Augmented and Virtual Reality, as well as quantum computing. The technologies once found in science fiction are starting to materialise, and experiences that we could only once dream of are becoming reality. Our challenge is to be alive to the possibilities and take practical steps to channel these technologies to ensure the continued prosperity of Singapore.
