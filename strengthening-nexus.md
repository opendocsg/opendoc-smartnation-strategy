{:start="67"}

67. Singapore has always believed in research, innovation and enterprise as cornerstones of our national strategy. We will need to continue to strengthen the nexus between academia and research centres and industry, to unlock economic potential. The Government These in turn are aligned with national priorities to tackle Singapore’s national challenges, such as improving healthcare and transforming our urban landscape for greater liveability and sustainability.

68. Public investment in research and innovation has continued to grow over the last 25 years. Most recently, the Government set aside S$400 million to support Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) in the Services and Digital Economy strategic technology domain from 2016 to 2020 under the **RIE 2020 Masterplan**. The domain includes programmes to drive digital innovation in urban mobility, healthcare ICT, and services productivity. It will also support the building of capabilities in AI, IoT and cybersecurity.

69. Singapore’s universities have also steadily risen up in global rankings and improved their research influence internationally. Singapore has attracted top research scientists and has strong partnerships with global research centres. We need to continue to ensure that these investments in R&D catalyse new economic activity.

70. To develop a vibrant startup ecosystem to leverage these opportunities, the Government has established the **Startup SG** programme which provides comprehensive support in areas such as funding, mentorship, talent attraction and internationalisation, among others. The public and private sector will work closer than ever to foster a strong ecosystem that attracts the top talent and capital, which allows the most innovative ideas to thrive.
