    ## **M**ake use of Government tech platforms and open data to build meaningful applications/design programmes for the community

    Data.gov.sg was first launched in 2011 as the government’s one-stop portal to its publicly-available datasets from 70 public agencies. To date, more than 100 apps have been created using the government’s open data.

    There are two types of APIs on data.gov.sg. One provides access to static tabular data such as time series or listings (i.e. CKAN APIs), while the other provides access to real-time datasets such as weather and traffic conditions. There are currently 14 real-time APIs on data.gov.sg that provide data ranging from taxi availability to weather forecasts.
